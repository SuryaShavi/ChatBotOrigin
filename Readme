CodeOrigin
CodeOrigin is a web-based tool that analyzes source code snippets and estimates whether they were written by a human or generated by an AI model. It provides a verdict, confidence score, and short explanations to help users understand the result.
⚠️ This project is experimental. Results are probabilistic and should not be used for high-stakes decisions.

🚀 What This Project Does
•	Accepts a code snippet from the user
•	Sends it to a backend analysis API
•	Classifies the code as Human-Written or AI-Generated
•	Displays:
o	Verdict (AI / Human)
o	Confidence percentage
o	Reasons for the decision
o	Model used for analysis
•	Maintains a short analysis history on the frontend
The UI uses a clean, modern design with a dynamic split-panel layout that appears after analysis.

📦 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SuryaShavi/ChatBotOrigin.git
cd ChatBotOrigin
________________________________________
2️⃣ Backend Setup (Server)
cd server
npm install
npm start
The backend will start at:
http://localhost:5000
You should see:
CodeOrigin API listening on 0.0.0.0:5000
________________________________________
3️⃣ Frontend Setup (Client)
cd ..
npm install
npm run dev
The frontend will be available at:
http://localhost:5173
________________________________________
4️⃣ Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory (optional if backend runs locally):
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
________________________________________
🔌 Backend API Requirement
The frontend expects a backend endpoint:
POST /analyze
Content-Type: application/json
Request Body
{
  "code": "string",
  "language": "auto | javascript | python | java | cpp"
}
Example Response
{
  "type": "ai",
  "confidence": 82,
  "reasons": [
    "Highly regular formatting",
    "Low comment density"
  ],
  "model": "Heuristic + OpenAI"
}

⚠️ Common Setup Note (Vite)
If you see this warning in the terminal:
Malformed URI sequence in request URL: /%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico
It means the favicon path is using Create React App syntax, which is not supported by Vite.
✅ Fix
Open index.html and replace:
<link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
with:
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
Then restart the dev server:
npm run dev
