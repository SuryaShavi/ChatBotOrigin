CodeOrigin
CodeOrigin is a web-based tool that analyzes source code snippets and estimates whether they were written by a human or generated by an AI model. It provides a verdict, confidence score, and short explanations to help users understand the result.
⚠️ This project is experimental. Results are probabilistic and should not be used for high-stakes decisions.

🚀 What This Project Does
•	Accepts a code snippet from the user
•	Sends it to a backend analysis API
•	Classifies the code as Human-Written or AI-Generated
•	Displays:
o	Verdict (AI / Human)
o	Confidence percentage
o	Reasons for the decision
o	Model used for analysis
•	Maintains a short analysis history on the frontend
The UI uses a clean, modern design with a dynamic split-panel layout that appears after analysis.
